This directory is for cses assignment, which deals with the excel library in the python programming.
My task was that classfying the gender data in the train.xlsx, using "re" library in the python and regular expression.
1. Read train.xlsx
2. Make a new excel file("assignment.xlsx") which has 4 sheets, "남성", "미혼 여성","기혼여성","기타"
3. Each sheet has data that originally was included in the "train.xlsx" file.
4. If one row in the "train.xlsx" contains "Mr." in any cells, then this whole row goes to the "남성" sheet in the "assignment.xlsx" that you just have made.
5. In the same way, "Mrs., Ms., Dr." etc. go to the corresponding sheet.
